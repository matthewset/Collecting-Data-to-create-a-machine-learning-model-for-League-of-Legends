# Collecting-Data-to-create-a-machine-learning-model-for-League-of-Legends
Rationale: I am new to machine learning and for my first machine learning project I want to analyze a correlation between win rates of individual members on your team and if the game results in a win/loss.

Program Description: 
This program takes data from my past 50 games (editable) and takes gets the win rate of every member on a team and checks if the result is a win or loss. It stores this data in a csv file with this format:

wr,wr,wr,wr,wr,win/loss
